# NBA Game Outcome Predictor

A machine learning projects that predicts the outcome of NBA games (home win or loss) using historical game data.
The model is trained on **26,651 NBA games** from the 2004‚Äì2018 seasons with a focus on a subset of home team statistics.  
This project applies **Logistic Regression** to determine whether the **home team** wins or loses.

**Model Accuracy:** ~76%  
**Key Insight**: *Field Goal (%)* happened to be the strongest predictor of a win, while assists contributed the least.

## Overview
- Data exploration - inital analysis of the dataset
- Preprocessing - handling missing values 
- Feature selection - choosing relevant statistics for prediction 
- Model training & evaluation - apply logistic regression
- Visualization of results - plotting and interpretation of results

## Workflow
1. **Data**  
   - Loaded 26,651 games from (2004-2018 season) using a CSV dataset.
2. **Define Targets and Features**  
   - Target: HOME_TEAM_WINS (1=Win, 0=Loss)
   - Selected relevant home team features (PTS, REB, AST, FG%, FT%, 3PT%).  
3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled 99 missing values with mean imputation
   - Restored DataFrame structure
4. **Train/Test Split**  
   - 80% training (21,320 games)
   - 20% testing (5,331 games)
5. **Model Training and Prediction**  
   - Trained logistic regression
   - Made predictions on test set
6. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Calculated the models accuracy using the test data (76.08%)
   - Generated detailed metrics

## Results
- **Accuracy:** The logistic regreession model achieved approximately 76% accuracy in predicting game outcomes on the test set.  
- **Insights:**  
  - Field Goal % (FG%) was the most important/influential feature for predicting a home win.  
  - Assists (AST) contributed the least in other words the least predictive feature in the model.
